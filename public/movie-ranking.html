<h1> THE BEST MOVIES ACCORDING TO GUDY K</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>1. City Hunter</h3>
<p>This is my favourite because its a korean action movie by my favourite actor Lee Min Ho. Amazing actions through out! One of the best story line i've seen!</p>
<h3>2. Jumong</h3>
<p>Also Korean. This is on the list because of the ancient genre and sword skills. Very thrilling story line!</p>
<h3>3. Boys Before Flowers</h3>
<p>I think this isn't no 1 because of my partiality towards action movies. It is here anyways because of my favourite korean actor- Lee Min Ho. Also it captures a high school setting and has quite an awesome story line.</p>
